\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The expansion of water when it is cooled below 4\textdegree{} C}
\end{itemize}

The Density of water is minimum at the temperature of 4\textdegree{} C at 1
gm/cc. Which is the standard density of water given in most places.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pratical Applications
\label{sec:orga8d67db}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Survival of Aquatic Creatures
\label{sec:orgcf24a12}
In Northern climates lakes would fully freeze over, rather than just
the surface because the surface would be the last to freeze anyway,
but because at 4C the water sinks. Meaning at 4C The lake would be
uniformly heated.

\item Water Pipes burst
\label{sec:orga8801eb}
The expansion of water causes the pipes to burst
\item Fruits Burst
\label{sec:orge228896}
The water present in each of the cells expand causing great pressure
\item Frost bite
\label{sec:orgc1d1027}
Similarly, for humans

\label{sec:orgd080c96}
It works on the prinnciple of electro magnetism.

\begin{itemize}
\item On pressing the key the current starts flowing in the circuit of the
\end{itemize}
electric bell.

\begin{itemize}
\item When the current passes through the electromegnet it
\end{itemize}
attracts the hammer towards itself which strikes the gong

\begin{itemize}
\item When the hammer touches the gong the circuit breaks down. Current
\end{itemize}
stops flowing, due to which the electromagent loses its
electromgentism and returns to its orignial positionn

\begin{itemize}
\item When the hammer comes back the setup is returned to its original position
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cribbing
\label{sec:orgbabba18}
If it do was as easy as to know what were good to do, Chapels had
been chruches as poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good
divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, that ne one of the twenty to follow mine
own teaching. The brain may devise laws for blood, but a hot temper
leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness of youth, to skit
o'er the meshes of good cousel, the cripple

\subsubsection{Red Cross}
\label{sec:org5d3b786}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Origin
\label{sec:org8854224}
Originated in Geneva, Switzerland The ICRC operates in over a 100
coutries, providing relief to patients all over the world.

Jean-Henri Dunant, 1859 went to meet the french emperor napoleon the
III, to talk about difficulties in bussiness in algeria, he arrived in
the small town of Solferino. Dunant was horrified by the death he saw
at the battle of solferino, every single day 40,00 soldiers died and
for that dunant devoted himself to their aid .Before which there
weren't many aid Gustave Moynier in 1863 received denuna't book and
but it for discussion at theosciety for public welfare in geneva.

Back at home he write a book called A memory of solferino

Since this was the 19th centuary, the international committee was
attencded by the autrian empire baden, bavaria, france, hanover,
hesse, italy, netherlands, prussia, russia, saxony, spain, UK, seden,
norway
\item WW1
\label{sec:orga08a63e}
The red cross beign an international organisation does not have much
power within countries, it has to work with the red cross
organisations of various countries. 

It is stunning to imagine that they were able to muster any effort at
all considering the leading medical science had barely even accepted
thories like germ theory, they were still in the age before
anasthesia.  Practices like amputation was the de-facto response to
any disease. Aroma theory was still prevailent. The sanitation
revolution after the cholera epidemic had only recently started.

Regardless, They had to face one if the greatest disasters in world history WWI

\item Periodic winds
\label{sec:org633d077}
Only during a certain part of the year, or season, or day.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Daily
\label{sec:org9759893}

\item Land Breeze

Land -> Sea
\end{enumerate}
\item Seasonal
\label{sec:orgbbd7fb2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monsoon
\label{sec:org459f6de}
Same cause as land and sea breeze but they are on the seasonal scale.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Summer Monsoon
\label{sec:org59bd549}
Wind blows from the Sea to the land as in summer the land mass has
lower pressure, coming from the ocean they bring rain and moisture to
the coastal region

\item Winter Monsoon
\label{sec:org58e9a54}
Much weaker, carries no water and is pretty much sporadic they winds
are cold and dry coming from central asia.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item Local Winds
\label{sec:org3491f66}

\label{sec:org5e3413a}
They are caused occasionally due to the movement of pressure systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cyclones
\label{sec:orgf46a523}
\item Anti-Cyclones
\label{sec:org414e3c7}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Pressure Belts
\label{sec:org1d1f69f}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Low pressure eq
\label{sec:org2d1eaec}
Makes Sense its pretty hot so low pressure. This forms clouds when the
water rises and makes cloud, this also explains daily rainfall
\item High pressure Sub tropical
\label{sec:org55e327c}
Doesn't really make sense its still pretty hot. The air which has
risen from the equator, will sink when it reaches slightly higher
latitudes. This also means that there won't be any clouds because all
the water leaves as the air cools, it evaporatoes off. This means that
the sky is clear. No cloud cover means extreme temperatures.

Off hand: "\emph{This is why there are desserts there"}

\item Low Pressure Sub Polar
\label{sec:org09a69ad}
\item High Pressure Polar
\label{sec:orgede77ff}
Makes sense its prety cold so high pressure
