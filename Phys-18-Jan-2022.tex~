The Density of water is minimum at the temperature of 4C at 1
gm/cc. Which is the standard density of water given in most places.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pratical Applications
\label{sec:orge9b1626}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Survival of Aquatic Creatures
\label{sec:orgfc2fa96}
In Northern climates lakes would fully freeze over, rather than just
the surface because the surface would be the last to freeze anyway,
but because at 4C the water sinks. Meaning at 4C The lake would be
uniformly heated.

length ).

Angle between the reflected ray and mirror
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Laws of Reflection}
\label{sec:org4e4fc25}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray are all in the same plance
\item The angle of incidence is equal to the angle if reflection
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Types of Images}
\label{sec:orgd41906e}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Real Image
\label{sec:orgcbb71e3}
Can be obtained on a screen. Is inverted. Example cinema screen
\item Virtual Image
\label{sec:orgded010a}
Can \uline{not} be obtained on a screen. Is errect. Example plane mirror.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Differences}
\label{sec:org2d4d126}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Parameter & Real & Virtual\\
\hline
Formation & It is fromed when two rays inersect at a point in front of the mirror & When two or more rays appear to meet behind a screen\\
Screen & It can be obtained on a screen & It can \uline{not}\\
Nature & It is always inverted & It is alwyas \uline{errect}\\

\item Cribbing
\label{sec:orgf801bdd}
If it do was as easy as to know what were good to do, Chapels had
been chruches as poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good
divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, that ne one of the twenty to follow mine
own teaching. The brain may devise laws for blood, but a hot temper
leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness of youth, to skit
o'er the meshes of good cousel, the cripple

\subsection{Red Cross}
\label{sec:orgbc45ab8}
\subsubsection{Origin}
\label{sec:org7cb093a}
Originated in Geneva, Switzerland The ICRC operates in over a 100
coutries, providing relief to patients all over the world.

Jean-Henri Dunant, 1859 went to meet the french emperor napoleon the
III, to talk about difficulties in bussiness in algeria, he arrived in
the small town of Solferino. Dunant was horrified by the death he saw
at the battle of solferino, every single day 40,00 soldiers died and
for that dunant devoted himself to their aid .Before which there
weren't many aid Gustave Moynier in 1863 received denuna't book and
but it for discussion at theosciety for public welfare in geneva.

Back at home he write a book called A memory of solferino

Since this was the 19th centuary, the international committee was
attencded by the autrian empire baden, bavaria, france, hanover,
hesse, italy, netherlands, prussia, russia, saxony, spain, UK, seden,
norway
\subsubsection{WW1}
\label{sec:org76312b1}
The red cross beign an international organisation does not have much
power within countries, it has to work with the red cross
organisations of various countries. 

It is stunning to imagine that they were able to muster any effort at
all considering the leading medical science had barely even accepted
thories like germ theory, they were still in the age before
anasthesia.  Practices like amputation was the de-facto response to
any disease. Aroma theory was still prevailent. The sanitation
revolution after the cholera epidemic had only recently started.

Regardless, They had to face one if the greatest disasters in world history WWI
