*** Northern Hemisphere
**** North Easterlies
Polar
**** South Westerlies
Variable
**** North-East Trade Winds
*** Southern Hemisphere
**** South-East Trade Winds
**** North Westerlies
Variable, AKA: Roaring Forties, Furious Fifties, Shrieking/Gloomy Sixties
**** South Westerlies
** Periodic winds
Only during a certain part of the year, or season, or day.
*** Daily
**** Sea Breeze
Sea -> Land
**** Land Breeze
Land -> Sea
*** Seasonal
**** Monsoon
Same cause as land and sea breeze but they are on the seasonal scale.
***** Summer Monsoon
Wind blows from the Sea to the land as in summer the land mass has
lower pressure, coming from the ocean they bring rain and moisture to
the coastal region

***** Winter Monsoon
Much weaker, carries no water and is pretty much sporadic they winds
are cold and dry coming from central asia.

** Local Winds
Localized only effect a small area
*** Loo
*** Chinook
*** Feohn
*** Mistral
** Variable Winds
They are caused occasionally due to the movement of pressure systems
*** Cyclones
*** Anti-Cyclones
* Pressure Belts
** Low pressure eq
Makes Sense its pretty hot so low pressure. This forms clouds when the
water rises and makes cloud, this also explains daily rainfall
** High pressure Sub tropical
Doesn't really make sense its still pretty hot. The air which has
risen from the equator, will sink when it reaches slightly higher
latitudes. This also means that there won't be any clouds because all
the water leaves as the air cools, it evaporatoes off. This means that
the sky is clear. No cloud cover means extreme temperatures.

Off hand: "/This is why there are desserts there"/

** Low Pressure Sub Polar
** High Pressure Polar
Makes sense its prety cold so high pressure
* Pressure Cells
- Hadley cell
  Between the eq and subtropical belts
- Ferrel cell
  Between the Sub Polar and and Sub tropical Belts
- Polar cell
  Between the polar and sub polar belts
