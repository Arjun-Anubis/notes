** Heat
*** Definition of temperature

- /Degree of hottness or coldness of an object./
- /Average total kinetic energy in an object/
/- It determines the direction of flow of heat/

Unit - K, C
*** Definition of Heat

/- Sum total energy of all the molecules in a substance/

~AKA:~ *Thermal Energy*, *Heat Energy*

Unit - Joule, Watt-Hour
1 cal = 4.126 Joule

The Density of water is minimum at the temperature of 4C at 1
gm/cc. Which is the standard density of water given in most places.

**** Pratical Applications

***** Survival of Aquatic Creatures
In Northern climates lakes would fully freeze over, rather than just
the surface because the surface would be the last to freeze anyway,
but because at 4C the water sinks. Meaning at 4C The lake would be
uniformly heated.

***** Water Pipes burst
***** Fruits Burst
***** Frost bite

**** TODO Q1 Q7
** Energy
** Reflection of light
*** The nature of light
- Light is a form of energy.
- Wave nature, particular nature, transverse
wave ( transverse - perpendicular ), ( logngitudinal is along the
length ).
**** TODO Speed of light 3 * 10^8 m/s ( by definition,  approx. 299,792,458 _
In air, same as vaccum, in glass 2, and in water 2.25

*** Reflection of light
- /Reflection is the phenomenon in which rays of light on striking a
surface are sent back into the same medium/
*** Definitions of Some terms
**** Points
1. Point of incidence
   Point where the ray strikes the mirror
2. Point of reflection
   Point from which the ray emerges
**** Rays 
1. Incident ray
   The ray that strickes the mirror's reflecting surface
2. Reflected ray
   The ray that emerges from the mirror
3. Normal
   A line drawn perpendicular to the mirror at the point of incidence
**** Angles
1. Angle of incidence
   Angle between the incident ray and normal
2. Angle of reflection
   Angle between the reflected ray and normal
3. Glance angle of incidence
   Angle between the incident ray and mirror
4. Glance angle of reflection
   Angle between the reflected ray and mirror
*** Laws of Reflection
1. The incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray are all in the same plance
2. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle if reflection
*** Types of Images
**** Real Image
Can be obtained on a screen. Is inverted. Example cinema screen
**** Virtual Image
Can _not_ be obtained on a screen. Is errect. Example plane mirror.
*** Differences
| Parameter | Real                                                                  | Virtual                                              |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Formation | It is fromed when two rays inersect at a point in front of the mirror | When two or more rays appear to meet behind a screen |
| Screen    | It can be obtained on a screen                                        | It can _not_                                           |
| Nature    | It is always inverted                                                 | It is alwyas _errect_                                |

Portia and nerissa discusss portia's suitor. First she cribs a little
bit about her father's rules and then it's made clear she likes
bassanio
***** Cribbing
If it do was as easy as to know what were good to do, Chapels had
been chruches as poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good
divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, that ne one of the twenty to follow mine
own teaching. The brain may devise laws for blood, but a hot temper
leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness of youth, to skit
o'er the meshes of good cousel, the cripple
