- /The expansion of water when it is cooled below 4\deg C/

The Density of water is minimum at the temperature of 4\deg C at 1
gm/cc. Which is the standard density of water given in most places.

***** Pratical Applications

****** Survival of Aquatic Creatures
In Northern climates lakes would fully freeze over, rather than just
the surface because the surface would be the last to freeze anyway,
but because at 4C the water sinks. Meaning at 4C The lake would be
uniformly heated.

****** Water Pipes burst
The expansion of water causes the pipes to burst
****** Fruits Burst
The water present in each of the cells expand causing great pressure
****** Frost bite
Similarly, for humans
***** TODO Q1 Q7
*** Energy
*** Reflection of light
**** The nature of light
- Light is a form of energy.
- Wave nature, particular nature, transverse
wave ( transverse - perpendicular ), ( logngitudinal is along the
length ).
***** TODO Speed of light 3 * 10^8 m/s ( by definition,  exact. 299,792,458 )
In air, same as vaccum, in glass 2, and in water 2.25

**** Reflection of light
- /Reflection is the phenomenon in which rays of light on striking a
surface are sent back into the same medium/
**** Definitions of Some terms
***** Points
1. Point of incidence
   Point where the ray strikes the mirror
2. Point of reflection
   Point from which the ray emerges
***** Rays 
1. Incident ray
   The ray that strickes the mirror's reflecting surface
2. Reflected ray
   The ray that emerges from the mirror
3. Normal
   A line drawn perpendicular to the mirror at the point of incidence
***** Angles
1. Angle of incidence
   Angle between the incident ray and normal
2. Angle of reflection
   Angle between the reflected ray and normal
3. Glance angle of incidence
   Angle between the incident ray and mirror
4. Glance angle of reflection
   Angle between the reflected ray and mirror
**** Laws of Reflection
1. The incident ray, the normal, and the reflected ray are all in the same plance
2. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle if reflection
**** Types of Images
***** Real Image
Can be obtained on a screen. Is inverted. Example cinema screen
***** Virtual Image
Can _not_ be obtained on a screen. Is errect. Example plane mirror.
**** Differences
| Parameter | Real                                                                  | Virtual                                              |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Formation | It is fromed when two rays inersect at a point in front of the mirror | When two or more rays appear to meet behind a screen |
| Screen    | It can be obtained on a screen                                        | It can _not_                                           |
| Nature    | It is always inverted                                                 | It is alwyas _errect_                                |

Non Uniform - Everything else
**** MLOF
**** Null Points
Points where the value of the magnetic field is 0.
**** Electro-Magnet
- /A manget whose magnetic field is induced by electric current/
**** Uses of Magnets
**** Electric Bell
It works on the prinnciple of electro magnetism.

- On pressing the key the current starts flowing in the circuit of the
electric bell.

- When the current passes through the electromegnet it
attracts the hammer towards itself which strikes the gong

- When the hammer touches the gong the circuit breaks down. Current
stops flowing, due to which the electromagent loses its
electromgentism and returns to its orignial positionn

- When the hammer comes back the setup is returned to its original position

****** Cribbing
If it do was as easy as to know what were good to do, Chapels had
been chruches as poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good
divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, that ne one of the twenty to follow mine
own teaching. The brain may devise laws for blood, but a hot temper
leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness of youth, to skit
o'er the meshes of good cousel, the cripple

*** Red Cross
**** Origin
Originated in Geneva, Switzerland The ICRC operates in over a 100
coutries, providing relief to patients all over the world.

Jean-Henri Dunant, 1859 went to meet the french emperor napoleon the
III, to talk about difficulties in bussiness in algeria, he arrived in
the small town of Solferino. Dunant was horrified by the death he saw
at the battle of solferino, every single day 40,00 soldiers died and
for that dunant devoted himself to their aid .Before which there
weren't many aid Gustave Moynier in 1863 received denuna't book and
but it for discussion at theosciety for public welfare in geneva.

Back at home he write a book called A memory of solferino

Since this was the 19th centuary, the international committee was
attencded by the autrian empire baden, bavaria, france, hanover,
hesse, italy, netherlands, prussia, russia, saxony, spain, UK, seden,
norway
**** WW1
The red cross beign an international organisation does not have much
power within countries, it has to work with the red cross
organisations of various countries. 

It is stunning to imagine that they were able to muster any effort at
all considering the leading medical science had barely even accepted
thories like germ theory, they were still in the age before
anasthesia.  Practices like amputation was the de-facto response to
any disease. Aroma theory was still prevailent. The sanitation
revolution after the cholera epidemic had only recently started.

Regardless, They had to face one if the greatest disasters in world history WWI

******* North Westerlies
Variable, AKA: Roaring Forties, Furious Fifties, Shrieking/Gloomy Sixties
******* South Westerlies
***** Periodic winds
Only during a certain part of the year, or season, or day.
****** Daily
******* Sea Breeze
Sea -> Land
******* Land Breeze
Land -> Sea
****** Seasonal
******* Monsoon
Same cause as land and sea breeze but they are on the seasonal scale.
******** Summer Monsoon
Wind blows from the Sea to the land as in summer the land mass has
lower pressure, coming from the ocean they bring rain and moisture to
the coastal region

******** Winter Monsoon
Much weaker, carries no water and is pretty much sporadic they winds
are cold and dry coming from central asia.

***** Local Winds
Localized only effect a small area
****** Loo
****** Chinook
****** Feohn
****** Mistral
***** Variable Winds
They are caused occasionally due to the movement of pressure systems
****** Cyclones
****** Anti-Cyclones
**** Pressure Belts
***** Low pressure eq
Makes Sense its pretty hot so low pressure. This forms clouds when the
water rises and makes cloud, this also explains daily rainfall
***** High pressure Sub tropical
Doesn't really make sense its still pretty hot. The air which has
risen from the equator, will sink when it reaches slightly higher
latitudes. This also means that there won't be any clouds because all
the water leaves as the air cools, it evaporatoes off. This means that
the sky is clear. No cloud cover means extreme temperatures.

Off hand: "/This is why there are desserts there"/

***** Low Pressure Sub Polar
***** High Pressure Polar
Makes sense its prety cold so high pressure
**** Pressure Cells
- Hadley cell
  Between the eq and subtropical belts
- Ferrel cell
  Between the Sub Polar and and Sub tropical Belts
- Polar cell
  Between the polar and sub polar belts
